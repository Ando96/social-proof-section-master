## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Still learning how to use flexbox properly, I feel like I learnt alot from this challenge such as nesting flexbox containers to achieve the layout I want.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still working through these front end mentor challenges to improve my HTML and CSS, while I feel I still struggle a bit when I first start and sometimes look
at completed solutions I've improved alot from when I first started - I couldn't even remember how to align content into the centre of the page on my first one. 
I just need to break through this mindset that I can't do it.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools] https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp - Has everything you need when it comes to HTML and CSS basics
- [MDN] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/- Has a lot of useful and interesting information about the different HTML and CSS tags, I find a new attribute or tag everytime I'm looking for something
